TrashSub: auto translate ASS dialogues with DeepL (free) API  
You have to use your own API KEY:  
Create `deepL.txt` file, put your private API KEY there and save it.
Put your `foo.ass` file in the same dir, rename it to `input.ass`.
**SLOW**
```bash
./main.py >> output.txt
```
The script is not too big, you can easily modify to your needs.
